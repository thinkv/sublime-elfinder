Element Finder
==============

Thanks for updating Element Finder to version st3-0.3.4

Element Finder now works on Sublime Text 3.

This is a continuation of Keegan's original ST2 Element Finder and supports both versions (https://github.com/keeganstreet/sublime-elfinder)

Please note that NodeJS is required to run Element Finder. If you do not have NodeJS installed, go to http://nodejs.org

If Element Finder still doesn't work, please follow these steps:
1. Go to Sublime Text 3 > Preferences > Package Settings > Element Finder > Settings - Default
2. Copy the default settings
3. Go to Sublime Text 3 > Preferences > Package Settings > Element Finder > Settings - User
4. Paste the settings
5. Change the "node_path" settings to point to NodeJS on your system
